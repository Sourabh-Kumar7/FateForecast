# FateForecast

"FateForecast" is a predictive modeling project focused on using Bayesian estimation techniques to forecast mortality risk in heart failure patients.

## Introduction

Heart failure is a critical health issue worldwide, leading to significant mortality rates. Traditional predictive models often overlook individual variabilities and uncertainties present in medical data. "FateForecast" aims to address these challenges by developing a Bayesian predictive model for mortality risk in heart failure patients.

## Features

- Predicts mortality risk in heart failure patients using Bayesian estimation techniques.
- Incorporates prior clinical knowledge and probabilistic understanding of patient outcomes.
- Provides insights into the uncertainties and relative importance of different predictors in heart failure outcomes.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/FateForecast.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```sh
   cd FateForecast
   
3. Install the required dependencies:

   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook installed on your system.
2. Open the `fate_forecast.ipynb` notebook using Jupyter Notebook.
3. Follow the instructions and execute the cells to run the project.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project comprises records of 368 patients who visited a cardiology hospital in Pakistan, with symptoms indicative of heart failure. It includes 60 quantitative parameters for each patient, such as age, smoking status, mortality during the hospital visit, and maximum heart rate achieved, among others. The dataset's diversity in variables allows for a detailed and nuanced modeling approach.
